Leaf mold is not normally a problem in field-grown tomatoes in northern climates. 
It can cause losses in tomatoes grown in greenhouses or high tunnels due to the higher humidity found in these environments.
Foliage is often the only part of the plant infected and will cause infected leaves to wither and die, indirectly affecting yield.
In severe cases, blossoms and fruit can also be infected, directly reducing yield.

Symptoms:

Pale greenish-yellow spots, usually less than 1/4 inch, with no definite margins, form on upper sides of leaves.
Olive-green to brown velvety mold forms on the lower leaf surface below leaf spots.
Lower side of tomato leaf with olive-green to brown velvety mold below leaf spots on upper side.
Olive green to brown velvety sporulation on the lower leaf surface
Leaf spots grow together and turn brown. Leaves wither and die but often remain attached to the plant.
Row of tomato plants, lower two thirds of plants have dead, brown leaves
Leaf death caused by severe leaf mold infection
Infected blossoms turn black and fall off.
Fruit infections start as a smooth black irregular area on the stem end of the fruit. As the disease progresses, the infected area becomes sunken, dry and leathery.
