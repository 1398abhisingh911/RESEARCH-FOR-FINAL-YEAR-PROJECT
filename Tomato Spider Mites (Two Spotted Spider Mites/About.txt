Spider mites (Tetranychus spp.) can ruin a tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) garden when they colonize the undersides of leaves and suck plant juices. Tiny arachnids, spider mites are in the same family as spiders and ticks and are one of the major pest problems of tomato plants.

Symptoms:

Feeding damage caused by sucking sap appears as many shiny pale yellow marks on the top of the tomato leaf (see lower photo). Eventually the leaves turn brown and die or fall off. Severe attack leads to formation of webs on the plant (see photo). Red spider mites are difficult but not impossible to control.
