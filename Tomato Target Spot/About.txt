Target spot on tomato fruit is difficult to recognize in the early stages, as the disease resembles several other fungal diseases of tomatoes. However, as diseased tomatoes ripen and turn from green to red, the fruit displays circular spots with concentric, target-like rings and a velvety black, fungal lesion in the center. The “targets” become pitted and larger as the tomato matures.

Symptoms:
The disease starts on the older leaves and spreads upwards. The first signs are irregular-shaped spots (less than 1 mm) with a yellow margin (Photo 1). Some of the spots enlarge up to 10 mm and show characteristics rings, hence the name of "target spot" (larger spots Photos 1&2). Spread to all leaflets and to other leaves is rapid (Photo 3), causing the leaves to turn yellow, collapse and die (Photo 4). Spots also occur on the stems. They are long and thin. Small light brown spots with dark margins may also occur on the fruit.

The spores are spread by wind-blown rain, and if windy wet weather continues for a few days, spread is fast and plants lose their leaves quickly.
