Late blight (Phytophthora infestans) fungus is in the same genus as the fungus causing pink rot (P. erythroseptica) (see "Tuber Rots"). Late blight was responsible for the Irish potato famine in the mid-nineteenth century (Daly, 1996). In the late twentieth century, there have been major re-occurrences and concern around the world over this pathogen and its disease due to recent mutations (Fry and Goodwin, 1997). These mutations, most notably strain US-8, have made the pathogen resistant to control by metalaxyl, the stand-by fungicide for many years. Some of these new pathogenic strains are also more aggressive and virulent than the old (US-1) strain that affected the world in the 19th century.

Symptoms:


Under continuously wet conditions, the disease progresses rapidly and warm, dry weather will slow or stop disease development. As conditions become moist and cool, disease development resumes. See pictures of late blight on stem and leaves.

Tuber lesions first appear as irregular, dark blotches. When cut open, affected tissue is water-soaked, reddish brown and extends with an irregular margin into the tuber flesh. Lesions may start as a superficial decay that continues to develop after tubers are harvested and placed into storage. Older lesions may become firm and sunken due to water loss and tubers will appear shrivelled. Infected tubers are commonly invaded by secondary decay organisms such as soft-rot bacteria and, therefore, are quite likely to decay during storage. Refer to the "Compendium of Potato Diseases."
