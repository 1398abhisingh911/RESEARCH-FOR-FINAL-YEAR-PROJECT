This disease is caused by Podosphaera clandestina, one of the common species of the powdery mildew group of fungi.The same fungus reportedly causes powdery mildew in peaches, apricots, apples, pears, quinces, persimmons, and a few ornamental plants.


Symptoms:
The fungus attacks leaves and twigs, producing symptoms much like powdery mildew on apples. Infected leaves curl upward. Newly developed leaves on new shoot growth become progressively smaller, are generally pale, and are somewhat distorted. New shoots are shorter in length than normal. By mid-season, the whitish fungus can be seen growing over the leaves and shoots, sometimes in patches and other times covering most of the new growth. Such symptoms are especially common in nursery trees. The growth of sour cherry trees in the nursery and in young orchards is reduced by this disease.


Solution:
Neem oil and PM Wash, used on a 7 day schedule, will prevent fungal attack on plants grown indoors.
