Black rot is a disease of apples that infects fruit, leaves and bark caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa. It can also jump to healthy tissue on pear or quince trees, but is typically a secondary fungus of weak or dead tissues in other plants. Begin checking your apple trees for signs of infection about a week after the petals fall from your apple blossoms.

Symptoms:

This fungus causes reddish brown cankers that are slightly below the level of the healthy bark around it. One unusual characteristic of these cankers is that they tend to spread more quickly along the length of the branch  rather than going around it.


Pesticide:
copper-based sprays
lime sulfur
