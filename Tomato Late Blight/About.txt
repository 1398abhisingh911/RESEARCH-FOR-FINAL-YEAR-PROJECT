Late blight is a potentially devastating disease of tomato and potato, infecting leaves, stems and fruits of tomato plants. The disease spreads quickly in fields and can result in total crop failure if untreated. Late blight of potato was responsible for the Irish potato famine of the late 1840s.

Symptoms:
Leaves have large, dark brown blotches with a green gray edge; not confined by major leaf veins.
Infections progress through leaflets and petioles, resulting in large sections of dry brown foliage.
Stem infections are firm and dark brown with a rounded edge.
Firm, dark brown, circular spots grow to cover large parts of fruits. Spots may become mushy as secondary bacteria invade.
In high humidity, thin powdery white fungal growth appears on infected leaves, fruit and stems.
Green tomato cut open. Tan to grey mushy infection near stem going into the flesh of the fruit
Infected fruit have a dry brown rot
Tomato fruit with firm, dark brown, circular spots covering large parts of fruits. White powdery spots in the middle.
In high humidity, powdery white spores form on infected fruit, leaves and stems
In cool, wet weather, entire fields turn brown and wilted as if hit by frost.
Environment
Spreads most in cool (60°F to 70°F), damp weather.
Prolonged hot dry days can halt pathogen spread.
