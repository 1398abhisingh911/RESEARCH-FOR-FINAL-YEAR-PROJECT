Apple scab occurs everywhere in the world where apples are grown and results in more losses than any other apple disease. It is most serious in areas that have cool, wet spring weather and may not be economically important in warm and/or dry climates.

Symptoms and Signs
Apple scab results in symptoms on most upper plant parts, most notably leaves and fruit.  Petioles, flowers, sepals, pedicels, young shoots, and bud scales can also become infected.

Apple leaf and fruit symptoms
Apple scab infections are initiated in early spring on emerging and young leaves.  Early lesions appear 10 days later as lighter green areas compared to the surrounding leaf tissue.
