Common rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi and occurs every growing season. It is seldom a concern in hybrid corn. Rust pustules usually first appear in late June. Early symptoms of common rust are chlorotic flecks on the leaf surface. These soon develop into powdery, brick-red pustules as the spores break through the leaf surface. Pustules are oval or elongated, about 1/8 inch long, and scattered sparsely or clustered together. The leaf tissue around the pustules may become yellow or die, leaving lesions of dead tissue. The lesions sometimes form a band across the leaf and entire leaves will die if severely infected. As the pustules age, the red spores turn black, so the pustules appear black, and continue to erupt through the leaf surface. Husks, leaf sheaths, and stalks also may be infected.

Symptoms:

Lesions begin as flecks on leaves that develop into small tan spots.
Spots turn into elongated brick-red to cinnamon-brown pustules with jagged appearance.
Found on both upper AND lower leaf surfaces (unlike southern rust)
Pustules turn dark brown to black late in the season.
