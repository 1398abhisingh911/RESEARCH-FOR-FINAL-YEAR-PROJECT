Bacterial spot is caused by four species of Xanthomonas and occurs worldwide wherever tomatoes are grown. Bacterial spot causes leaf and fruit spots, which leads to defoliation, sun-scalded fruit, and yield loss. Due to diversity within the bacterial spot pathogens, the disease can occur at different temperatures and is a threat to tomato production worldwide. Disease development is favored by temperatures of 75 to 86 ? and high precipitation. In North Carolina, it is more prevalent in seasons with high precipitation and less prevalent during dry years

Symptoms:

On tomato, leaf lesions are initially circular and water-soaked and may be surrounded by a faint yellow halo. In general, spots are dark brown to black and circular on leaves and stems. Spots rarely develop to more than 3 mm in diameter. Lesions can coalesce causing a blighted appearance of leaves and a general yellowing may occur on leaves with multiple lesions. Infected pepper leaves drop prematurely; this exposes fruit to the sun and results in sun scalding. Fruit lesions begin as small, slightly raised blisters, which become dark brown, scab-like, and can appear slightly raised as they increase in size.

On leaflets, bacterial spot can be easily confused with the early symptoms of bacterial speck, early blight, gray leaf spot, target spot, or Septoria leaf spot. When Xanthomonas is present, bacteria will ooze (also referred to as bacterial streaming) from infected tissue and can be observed under a light microscope. Bacterial streaming will not be observed in lesions caused by fungal pathogens.
