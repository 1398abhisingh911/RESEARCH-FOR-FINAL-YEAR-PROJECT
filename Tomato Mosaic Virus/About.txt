Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and  Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) are hard to distinguish.
Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) can cause yellowing and stunting of tomato plants resulting in loss of stand and reduced yield.
ToMV may cause uneven ripening of fruit, further reducing yield.
Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was once thought to be more common on tomato. 
TMV is usually more of a tobacco pathogen than a tomato pathogen.

Symptoms:

Mottled light and dark green on leaves.
Young tomato leaf that is mottled light and dark green, stunted growth, curled and malformed leaves.
