Bacterial spot, known also as bacteriosis, bacterial shothole, or shothole, is caused by the bacterium
Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni. Although primarily
a peach and nectarine problem, this disease also occurs
on apricots, plums and, to a lesser degree, cherries.
Losses due to bacterial spot occur from affected
fruit and from the devitalization of trees caused by
frequent defoliation. Such weakened trees are more
subject to winter injury. Losses are greatest in light,
low-fertility soils. Trees low in vigor are more susceptible to bacterial spot than vigorous trees.

Symptoms:

Numerous small spots form on the leaves. The
spots are angular, purple to purplish-brown or black.
Spots may merge and the centers may fall out, giving
the characteristic “shothole” appearance. Heavily
infected leaves turn yellow and drop. Severe leaf loss
early in the summer reduces fruit size and weakens the
tree. A few lesions can result in severe defoliation on
sensitive varieties; tolerant varieties may require many
more lesions for defoliation.
