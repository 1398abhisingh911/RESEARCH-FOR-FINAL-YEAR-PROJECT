Strawberry plants are classified as a forb or herb. Forb/herb plants are ones that don’t have significant amounts of woody tissue above the ground but are still vascular. Their lack of woody tissue causes them to be relatively short (their stems will not thicken and stiffen to support tall growth like non-forb/herb plants will).
Additionally, the presence of perennating buds on strawberry plants further causes them to fall within this category of plants. These perennating buds allow the strawberry plants to survive the winter and produce strawberry flowers again in the spring. More specifically, perennating buds are ones that are formed prior to unfavorable conditions (i.e. winter) and then die back when the cold hits. The buds are supported throughout the dormant winter period and then come to life again in the spring. They are supported and formed within the strawberry plant crown.
