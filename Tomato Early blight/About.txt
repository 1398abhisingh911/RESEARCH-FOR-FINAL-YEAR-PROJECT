Early blight is a fungal disease, Alternaria sp., that occurs on tomatoes throughout North America. Early blight can affect seedlings but is generally observed on older plants and is especially severe on plants of poor vigor. Plants infected with the fungus can display collar rust on the stems, infected older leaves, and fruits that crack at the stem. Infection on leaves is the most common symptom.

Symptoms:

The appearance of circular or irregular dark spots on the lower, more mature leaves is one of the first symptoms of infection. Eventually, the spots enlarge into a series of concentric rings surrounded by a yellow area. The entire leaf may be killed and will drop off the plant. Early blight can result in extensive defoliation, exposing fruit to sunscald and reducing yields. This disease typically progresses from the base of the plant, upward.
