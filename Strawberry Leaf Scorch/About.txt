Scorched strawberry leaves are caused by a fungal infection which affects the foliage of strawberry plantings. The fungus responsible is called Diplocarpon earliana. Strawberries with leaf scorch may first show signs of issue with the development of small purplish blemishes that occur on the topside of leaves.


Symptoms:
Over time, the spots will continue to grow larger and darken. In severe cases, dark spots may even cover entire portions of strawberry plant leaves and cause them to completely dry and fall from the plant. Though the foliage of the infected plants is not aesthetically pleasing, it is seldom that the presence of this fungus impacts the quality of the strawberry crop itself.
